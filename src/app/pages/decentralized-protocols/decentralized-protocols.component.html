      Central Hash was designed to be accessed in the most hostile environments possible, such as dictatorships, wars,
      and other various situations in which an individual's basic human rights could be put at risk.

    <h1>Use IPFS for fast decentralized access</h1>

    <p>
      IPFS, is a decentralized and peer-to-peer system. Instead of relying on a single server, it breaks files into
      smaller chunks and distributes them across a network of computers. When you want to access a file or a website,
      your device fetches these chunks from multiple sources, making the process more resilient, faster, and
      censorship-resistant.

      with IPFS.

    <h1>Use TOR for privacy and decentralization</h1>

    <p>
      When you use the regular web, websites can see your IP address and potentially track your online activities. Tor
      helps protect your privacy by bouncing your internet traffic through a network of volunteer-operated servers,
      making it difficult for websites or anyone else to trace your online actions back to you.
